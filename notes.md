First step was to convert from .data to .csv
and then to convert everything in JSON objects.


#! VERY IMPORTANT !#
Process data as such to create groups of 10 in terms of
age, capital gains / loss, etc. Create groups based on
splitting averages. Split the averages by equally distributing
values.

Add optional conversion to JSON
Type conversion as well, when writing the dictionary
Percentage of people based on categories

xx% of people of age XX have income > 50k
xx% of white people have income > 50k
etc. etc. etc.

Do not forget to add DOCSTRINT

Must add an incrementor / decrementor when checking for age,
capital gains or losses as the exact values might not be present
inside the trained model

Put together chart of data transition in .ppt, to see how data is moved and modified (???)
