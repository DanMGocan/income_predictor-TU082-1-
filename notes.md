First step was to convert from .data to .csv
and then to convert everything in JSON objects.

1. Convert data from .csv to a long dictionary
1.1. Clear the data from #3, #4, #14
2. Randomly separate the information in two
categories: learning and test (80% vs. 20%)


Add optional conversion to JSON
Type conversion as well, when writing the dictionary
Percentage of people based on categories

xx% of people of age XX have income > 50k
xx% of white people have income > 50k
etc. etc. etc.

TUG OF WAR Optimization system, maybe?
