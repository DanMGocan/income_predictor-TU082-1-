## Project made by Dan Gocan, for TU082 program, under the Technical University of Dublin, for Programming and Algorithms course. 

### Description
The program takes a set of datum (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data) and builds a classifier using a simplified random forrest algorith. The code is split in two folders, Data and Execution. All static
files are in the Data folder, being rewritten everytime the program is executed. The Execution folder holds all the
Python code that cleans, converts and processes the data.
